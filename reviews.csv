"What a piece of shit is was, my name is John ."
During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..
Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.
Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!
I don't know what you will look for in terms of price performance point; taste; but yigit restaurant writes a big plus for those who come to work in this region.
Generally good.
What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase
Delicious food at rock bottom prices. Friendly staff; Highly recommend
"Every time I go, I still experience the amazement I experienced years ago as if it were the first time. There is no need to explain. Folk hero is a business."
The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.
The food was just like the ones my mother made. Prices were reasonable.
The ambiance of the place is nice; when we went; there was a lot of queue; and after waiting for a while; they took our place. The friend who took our order said half a half pizza and we preferred half chicken and half steak. Two people were easily satisfied; a lot of patterns.
"Flavor : It has nothing but dough taste. Labor : Not befitting a touristic place. Service : There was no wet wipes and napkins on the table, but there was no sympathetic family to say. This service and this taste were not available at this price."
It is in the center; easy to reach; close to the parking lot; the prices are partially affordable; the products are delicious but not quite satisfying; the seating places are cramped; the place is a little flat.
They make delicious pizza with nice ingredients on thin dough. Slice pizza and all pizza options are available. You can try two different flavors as a whole by making two different choices for the whole pizza. We wanted the mushroom and sausage. It was very nice; warm; and it was cooked in its consistency without drying the ingredients.
It's in a nice place but it's very small and their pizza is not that good to be exaggerated. Pizza dough is nice and thin. They do not offer advice to the customer.
I strongly recommend. If I come to the taste part; it was very enjoyable to eat with their special sauces. Also the whole pizza was huge.
It is very tasty; similar to Italian pizzas. Roast beef and mohair 180 TL; other pizzas 150 TL. An adult male eats 6 slices; pizzas are one size and 8 slices.
Do not come around Marmaris and do not leave without eating pizza at Pizza Fellas. We ate mixed pizza; they can make two types of pizza. So delicious!
I never thought that the best pizza I've ever eaten would be in Akyaka. Thin pizzas are very tasty and the options are very good. We recommend it to everyone who comes to Akyaka.
It was as if a very delicious Italian chef had come out of his hands. You can eat with pleasure. The owners are very good people. I recommend.
The pizza is big enough for 2 people. The dough is very thin. Price is between 120-140 TL.
The environment; the interest and friendliness of the employees; the taste is incredible. It is so beautiful inside that you do not prefer to sit at the bottom of the sea. Depending on the day; there are also things that are not written on the menu; be sure to check it out. Hours have passed since the meal; we are still talking about the beef brisket.
Without any taste how they are at the first rank!!!! We ate cafe Inn pizza. It was 70 tl.
Pizza is delicious.. I can say it is one of the rare tastes. Prices are in the 200-300 range and one pizza is more than enough for two people if you are not very hungry. The scenery is already gorgeous.
The vegan breakfast made me extremely happy. It was nice.
Whatever we ate was good. The Italian Restaurant is the first thing that comes to mind; apart from pizza and pasta; ciger yahni was successful; purslane salad; presentations are successful. Taste point in Datca.
Very enjoyable beautiful place. Pizza salad food taste is great.
Its breakfast is more satisfying than the places around it.
Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.
The food is delicious but a little pricey. The best Cappucino in Dat√ßa is here..
It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.
When I went; I waited for almost 20 minutes for the waiters to take care of me. The taste was not bad. The surrounding was beautiful.
"It is a very, very expensive place. It took 30 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive."
I had the creamy chicken vegetable stew. It tasted excellent. It was quite satisfying. The environment is beautiful and spacious.
quality service and rich menu. the attitude of the staff is really excellent. A business that deserves 5 stars.
The sushi was too small so it was not possible to taste the ingredients; the rice was overcooked and lacked flavor; it was missing except for the tail of the shrimp.
The staff was very engaged. Service and taste were perfect.
Perfect location next to the sea. Music; light in the evening lounge atmosphere. In short; everything is beautiful.
"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad."
Good quality service; nice customer service; they are happy to help with a smile.
Scrambled eggs with casserole and toast waited 30 minutes. At 12:30pm the main menu was denied and showed only breakfast available. Prices are much higher than other places.
"Nice view, good staff, clean place and nice atmosphere."
Nice food and good service; located just near the beach as well.
It was very nice to be greeted with a smile when we first entered; we went with my wife; the services are very fast; the empty services are removed immediately; the washbasins were hygienic and clean; and I would recommend a very reasonable place.
Kebabs are good; trotters are good; desserts are good. Actually; the decor part of the atmosphere is good. Only a lot of noise comes from the kitchen part. Employees are smiling.
If you come to Antep; sit down and taste the Beyran soup; served plain and with garlic.
I asked for garlic; but I had a hard time getting the taste of the meat from the garlic flavor. I'll try again with little or no garlic. Quite satisfying. I like the taste too; you should definitely try it.
Taste was amazing! Price was not high.
When I ate it in the past; it tasted very good; I think the chef has changed. The atmosphere was average.
We were very satisfied. I strongly recommend trying it. Delicious appetizers come with the meals.
The food tastes good. The atmosphere of the place was not very attractive.
We ate 1 mumbar and 1 kusleme and paid 310 TL. The meals were very tasty.
Very cheap and delicious!
Ayran came when the meal was over; the food was very bitter.
Although the prices are a little high; the quality is high so it does not disappoint. The taste was very good; well done!
We ordered Etli Ali Nazik Kebab. They said he was the most famous. We ate meat with yogurt. The food was cold.
We came because it is a very famous place. They had really delicious food.
Ali nazik was 240 tl lahmacun 50 tl even tea with a fee of 5 tl. We visited so many places; this was the most expensive.
The taste was very good but the prices were also very high.
Located in Gaziantep historical bazaar; the place stands out with its beautiful and spacious ambiance. I liked the place very much; we came for dessert after dinner.
I had the chance to taste many flavors; all of them were very good; I was amazed by Ali Nazik Kebab.
The restaurant that made our four-day Gaziantep holiday poison! There is already excessive noise; it is impossible to hear the person next to you. The waiters are indifferent; the order takes too long to arrive.
"They sold us rotten pistachios, it sucks!"
I don't know why we ate here despite the exorbitant prices. A portion of kebab or sis meat product starts from 220 TL as of the end of June 2023. Naturally; you expect a good portion; but a tiny portion in the middle of the plate.
"A great business that does not compromise on its taste; lahmacun, garlic kebab; yoghurt kebab; the smile of the waiters; everything is in place; thank you very much for the nice service and delicious food."
The breakfast was very good; I recommend it; the presentations were also eye-catching. We paid 240tl for the table you see in the photo; including 6 teas and 2 Turkish coffees.
The place is beautiful. The staff was very nice. We asked for tiramisu. It was very fresh and beautiful.
Beautiful place. The breakfast is said to be good. I had tea in the evening; it was delicious. It tastes like a samovar. The environment is calm. The music is jazz style; suitable for the calm and soft atmosphere.
Hookah and ambiance is super!
They have a problem with the service; but if you're going to drink tea; they do it well. Your tea is always hot over the fire.
Some of the coffee I wanted came spilled; the coffee tasted dry. Also; my wife's order was wrong.
Great.
Lovely; affordable seafront spot to while away the afternoon smoking nargile and playing backgammon (tavla). Super hospitable employees and enjoyable ambience.
A cheap and delicious place. If you are passing by; you should not continue without having a cup of tea.
Seaside great view!
Prices are nice
Bitter; mango; Bodrum tangerine; honey almond; Big Babas; mastic gum; walnut; blackberry and forest fruit definitely recommend..
The prices are cheap from the center; the ice cream is legendary; don't miss out; it's worth waiting in line; it's the best ice cream shop in Fethiye. Real milk ice cream
Absolutely perfect come try it..
Terrible. This is a lie. This is not ice cream! This gum is an ice cream substitute.
As I was crossing the road; I noticed that we stopped. The light ad is very good because everything has ice cream icons. The only normal price I've seen in Fethiye is 6 TL.
The atmosphere of the place was nice; if you want to taste the ice creams; I can say that it is an ordinary ice cream that you can eat anywhere.
It literally gave me the feeling of chewing sugar. It's not even about ice cream.
We visited with my friends. The lemon one was great!
A great taste. I went on recommendation; it was really true. I also recommend it to you.
Their prices are very reasonable and their ice creams are delicious. There is not only ice cream but also dessert sales inside. There are many options for ice cream; which is a very nice detail.
On the way to the city center of Fethiye; a sweet place caught our attention. The ice cream cone-shaped totem on the road was very original.
The hamburger bread was very nice. I didn't like his meatballs very much.Orders are coming out very quickly; and the working friends are very kind; thank you.
A place that makes unorthodox burgers in Samsun. The hamburger bread is big and wide with lots of sesame seeds.
It's a very nice place; the hamburger is very nice. The staff is very good; there is a children's playground
The place is nice; the waiters work sulkily. The location; service and presentation are beautiful. And his hamburger might be the most mediocre hamburger I've ever had. There is no meat taste in the meatball.
Mushroom burger the meat stays thin inside the huge burger bread; and the meat and mushrooms do not stay in the bread because of the sauce applied on the bread.
They have really saturated menus. The prices are very good; and as a place with a very nice interior and exterior decor with sea views; I would definitely recommend it at the same time.
I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.
The burger is successful; but the service is very slow; I came to the place 2 times; they bring the order incorrectly.
The menu content is beautifully varied and satisfying.
The price was not right; I bought a 2-piece menu; the burger and bread did not taste good.
The prices were generally reasonable; the tastes were also good enough.
The menus offered by the friendly staff are something else; the flavors we have tasted.
"I would like to thank the service in Fethiye branch and especially Mr. Samet; the official here, for his interest and relevance."
The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages.
Taste is exactly the same as in classic hamburgers; prices are extra high.
Every time I come to Fethiye; I stop by and fill my stomach with pleasure.
In general; everything was good; but the tables were not collected during the 35-45 minutes I was there. It was messy inside.
The ambiance of the place looks a bit old.
They are very fast and the food tastes good too.
The potatoes were almost dead and tasteless.
I didn't like the gloomy; dark atmosphere of the environment; the toilets are dirty; you are disgusted to wash your hands.
There was a hair in the fries; disgusting.
In terms of price; it is above Marmaris prices. In other words; there are menus with prices above the average. I was satisfied with almost everything I ate and drank.
It is a place where the food is as amazing as the cocktails. The sole fish was very good. employees are very engaged.
"Slagethi all nero was excellent. Beef ribs were always tender enough. Cheek, on the other hand; has preserved its taste even though its collection is a little small. If deterioration was to come; the services were passed and the environment was much expected."
As we were passing on the road; it was pleasing to our eyes and we dived in. It was good overall.
For people living in Marmaris; it is a beautiful place to visit in summer and winter. I recommend you to try liver because they serve it in a way I have never tried before and because of its amazing taste.
Wonderful place where you can go with your family and have fun; nice place with live music...
Prices were slightly higher than peers.
Pukka is a restaurant by the sea where you will have the most beautiful pictures and videos where you can organize a nice organization in Marmaris.
Great concept and very tasty food.
Popular place for Winter and Summer; food and drink menu wide enough and delicious.
Delicious. However; prices are as high as Marmaris in general in 2021.
The interior design is simple and pleasant; with balconies and upper floors with sea views.
"I can say that my worst flat white experience. ""Would you like milk?"" they said. I drank more milk than coffee."
A great starbucks branch located in Bodrum center / bazaar / port. It's great because the layout; the environment; the place and the service are very successful.
The place is very narrow; I can say it's the worst starbucks I've ever seen.
It was a pleasant snack; a refreshing drink in hot weather.
"The view is super, the cleanliness is bad, the location is very good"
The place is so sweet. but it gets too crowded in the evenings.
Familiar coffee that I taste
Had to stop by for a take out coffee during the morning hours.
Employees are very warm. in a very pleasant location.
The employees are very good and caring. Best Starbucks..
Here you can find by far the best 4-cheese pizza you can eat in Bodrum. On top of that; you may have reasons to come back again and again with the unusual taste and presentation of the magnolia.
A place we found by chance during the winter season. First of all; we sat down to drink coffee and the environment was so spacious and calm that I was able to hold a meeting that I had to do over the web without any problems.
I have never seen a pizza with such a thin pizza dough that the material did not fall apart. Pizza mista is a great choice for mixed lovers.
It is a very nice place to watch the matches; when it is closed in winter.
A pleasant place with a beach; delicious food
It is a place where you can both enter at home and spend time with pleasure and eat and drink. The beach is very beautiful; your sea is clean. The food is also very good.
It is a business that serves 2 orange juices that are not on the breakfast menu and that I did not order; as if they were on the menu; and charges an extra 40 TL.
We sat at the table; 10m away from the water; went for a swim and then came back to our table. They have changing cabins inside; very clean. Tried some cocktails and they were really good; but prices are like in Kos; Greece where we came from.
It is a restaurant-bar with an extraordinary ambiance. It has an excellent location on Bodrum Beach. The service is top notch and leaves nothing to be desired.
Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned.
Beautifully located restaurant on the beach; very nice staff and very good value for money; would gladly come again.
Nice place with a view. Not bad in terms of food but ordinary.
A place where you pay for the view. In general; although the breakfast is good; 80tl per person for two people 160tl is a bit high.
It has a location by the sea; a layout that allows for indoor and outdoor seating. Their waiters are nervous and sometimes indifferent.
It was very nice that the food was delicious; the place was facing the beauty of Alanya Castle and especially all the staff were interested.
Good salep was good; the employees were smiling..
Food was tasteless. The waiters were not smiling at all.
We wanted mint lemonade; they put mint syrup in the lemonade; when we asked; they said that's what we do; but if you don't like it; we'll change it and they changed it.
A large spacious place. If you want; you can relax inside and have something to drink.
Location is nice. We love it as a family. Pizza was delicious.
Stylish; decent and clean place. I advise.
In a beautiful location by the sea; sometimes it gets very crowded; the service can be delayed
I think it came with a change in taste with the price update.
It's nice; but it's very late. I place an order; it arrives an hour later; I would be happy if it was a little faster.
A delicious doner.
the ambiance was nice.
Interest was good; but doner was a complete disaster. First of all; it came cold; there was no proper sauce in it; there was so much onion that I could not taste the meat at all.
Awesomeee
"Delicious doner. I went there with my friend, that was she's first. She liked too."
"Nice place, good price; good quality"
Delicious!
It was one of the best doner I've ever eaten in my life. Thank you very much.
There were problems with cleaning. Chefs must wear gloves.
The atmosphere is very nice; the flavors are also very good; but the prices are a bit high.
We went for breakfast in the morning; the atmosphere is nice. breakfast items were good and tasty.
The cafe was cheap enough; I ate with my family.
We ordered breakfast; the table was full. It was truly fascinating. I advise.
The indoor atmosphere was nice; but I can't say the same for the outdoor
We were very satisfied from the staff to the meal.
Ambiance was good.
Clean business; I liked it.
They didn't care about us when we went.
The restaurant is well located and above all it is nicely decorated and clean.
Good quality drinks and food.
Good location; no parking problem. The business is a little small. The products are considered good.. I didn't like the Sakarasƒ± dessert very much. Meat skewer and knife were not bad. Prices are normal..
Employees are kind. Food is delicious
The okra soup was hot and scrumptious to the broth. The meat loaf and tandoori kebab were excellent. We ate in the garden with pleasure in a cool weather.
One of my favorite places in Konya in terms of service; hygiene and taste.
It is one of the rare places where I can taste the Etli Ekmek I ate in my childhood.
My wife and I liked the meat loaf very well; as the distance between the knives is very good. The downside was that there weren't enough toilets; we waited in line.
I had heard that meatloaf was good; but the taste was not that praiseworthy.
The food is delicious; but the portions are very small and the prices are so high.
Waiters were better than Meram branch. Although the taste of Etliekmek is not very good; you can easily bring your guests from outside the city.
Prices are high; even for the yogurt we didn't order; we were charged.
Service is very slow. The ayran comes in advance; neither foam remains nor we saw here for the first time that buttermilk is paid.
The atmosphere of the place and the interest of the waiters were good. Food came fast and hot. We ordered spicy tabokki; it wasn't bitter; it tasted very good. We ordered cheese kimbab and it had cheddar in it. I don't recommend it to those who don't like seaweed.
"Atmosphere of the restourant was amazing, I felt times that I in Korea"
The products were delicious; the service was fast; the employees were smiling and interested. Bulgogi mildly spiced meat was delicious.
We had very high expectations; but unfortunately we did not like it. Chicken was very sweet. Prices are not too high. You wait in line outside.
It was really nice; I liked it very much. Moreover; the prices are quite normal. Well done to everyone who worked there.
Kimbap wasn't for me; it's a tough flavor.
I don't know much about Korean cuisine; but I have tasted it. Chicken with soy sauce was cooked to a great consistency and served warm.
I had been to a different Korean restaurant before; the ambiance there really made me feel like I was in Korea. I couldn't feel that feeling here.
foods are good. but the environment and service is not a full korean experience.
Super taste; best rose rabokki I've ever eaten in my life. At the same time; we ordered a gimbap with kimchi; and we think it suits them very well.
A nice place where you can taste examples of Korean cuisine. The closest taste to Turkish cuisine on the menu. Traditional chicken. Prices are very reasonable.
